# Code of Conduct

## Our goal
We want this project (issues, discussions, PRs, and any other repo spaces) to be a friendly, technical place to collaborate on **42dB_STM32_DSP_engine**.

## Be respectful
- Be kind and assume good intent.
- Keep feedback focused on the work: code, design, measurements, documentation.
- No harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, or discrimination.

## Keep it constructive and on-topic
- Stay on-topic and technical.
- Off-topic posts, advertising/spam, or heated arguments will be closed without debate.
- If a conversation starts going in circles, maintainers may lock it to keep things productive.

## How to ask for help (recommended)
When reporting a problem, include:
- Hardware details (exact STM32 part/board, clocks, sample rate, I2S wiring)
- Toolchain + versions
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Minimal repro steps, logs, and/or measurements

## Enforcement
Maintainers may edit, hide, or remove content, and may block users who violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated or severe violations may be reported to GitHub.

## Scope
This applies within this repository’s spaces (Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests, etc.).
