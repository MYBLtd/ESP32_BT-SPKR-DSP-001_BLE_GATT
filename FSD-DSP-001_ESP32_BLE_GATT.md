## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document specifies the functional requirements, behaviour, interfaces and constraints of a Bluetooth audio receiver processing an audio stream and driving a loudspeaker.

The FSD is intended to:

- Define **what the system shall do**, not how it is implemented internally
- Serve as a reference for development, testing and future extensions
- Be understandable by engineers, educators and technically inclined users

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 System Description
The system offers a headless user interface (no buttons/GUI on the speaker) that allows users to use their phone to:

- Select presets (e.g., Office, Full, Night, Speech)
- Toggle loudness (on/off)
- Mute/unmute audio
- Enable Audio Duck (panic button for quick volume reduction)
- Enable Normalizer (dynamic range compression)

Audio is streamed via Bluetooth Classic A2DP. Control is via BLE GATT. A dedicated companion app is not required: control is possible with generic BLE apps (nRF Connect/LightBlue) or the 42 Decibels iOS app.

### 2.2 Scope (v1.1)

**In scope:**
- DSP preset engine: fixed EQ-curves per preset
- Loudness overlay (on/off)
- Mute function with smooth fade
- Audio Duck (panic button) with ~25% volume reduction
- Normalizer (dynamic range compression)
- Protection chain: high-pass + limiter
- BLE GATT control plane (write + status notify)
- Persistent storage of settings
- GalacticStatus extended status reporting

**Out of scope**
- Room calibration / microphone-measuring
- Wi-Fi SoftAP UI
- OTA updates (planned for v1.2)

### 2.3 Design-principles

A2DP audio in -> decode -> DSP (EQ/presets/loudness/normalizer/limiter) -> I2S out -> amplifier/driver.

BLE Controls send discrete settings to DSP without interrupting audio.
Robust: no audio stuttering due to control traffic.

Simple UX: buttons/presets and toggles, no 'pro audio' terms needed.

Driver protection first: bass boost should never cause driver/amp clipping or over-excitation.

### 2.4 Assumptions and parameters

Since the exact driver/enclosure may still be unknown, this document uses practical defaults that can be easily tuned later.

Assumptions (default):
- Driver: small full range (40-70 mm)
- Enclosure: suboptimal/small volume -> limited real low end
- Sample rate: 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz (DSP must support both)
- Mono or stereo: DSP must support stereo

## 3 Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Bluetooth functionality

**FR-1**
The system shall publish its system name on Bluetooth to allow devices to connect to it.

**FR-2**
The system understands iOS Bluetooth security and is able to let an iOS device connect to it.

**FR-3**
The system receives an audio stream from the connected device.

**FR-4**
The system processes the received audio stream and outputs it using I2S.

**FR-5**
The system supports both 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz sample rates.

**FR-6**
The system uses a robust mechanism to recover itself from crashes or other malfunctioning.

### 3.2 DSP functionality

**FR-7**
Global DSP headroom (requirement):
Pre-gain: -6 dB (default) to cleanly accommodate EQ boosts + loudness + limiter.

**FR-8**
The system implements 4 presets:
- OFFICE (office/background)
- FULL (full/rich)
- NIGHT (low volume / evening)
- SPEECH (podcast/speech)

**FR-9**
User can toggle loudness: with a toggle, make low-volume playback fuller and clearer.
- Loudness is on/off
- Loudness overlay is mild and designed for low volume
- Loudness overlay must not make limiter behavior extremely "pumpy"

**FR-10** Bass/Treble discrete steps (optional v1.2)
- Bass boost level: 0..3
- Treble level: 0..2

**FR-11**
Safety: the speaker must not distort or "bottom out" due to overly aggressive bass.

**FR-12** Persistent storage
- Last selected preset and loudness state are stored in NVS/flash.
- Write frequency is limited: only save after 1-2 s without changes or on a commit event.

**FR-13** Live parameter updates
- Parameter updates must not cause audible clicks (20-50 ms ramp on gains/filters).
- DSP remains real-time; control tasks must not block audio tasks.

**FR-14**
Latency: control updates feel < 150 ms (best effort).

**FR-15**
Stability: BLE connect/disconnect must not interrupt A2DP audio.

**FR-16**
CPU budget: DSP chain within real-time budget on ESP32 (no large FFTs in v1).

**FR-17**
Memory: no dynamic allocations in the audio callback.

**FR-18**
GalacticStatus characteristic:

- Characteristic: GalacticStatus
- UUID: `00000004-1234-5678-9ABC-DEF012345678`
- Properties: READ, NOTIFY
- Length: 7 bytes

| Byte | Field                   | Value   | Description                              |

| 1    | currentQuantumFlavor    | 0-3     | Current preset ID                        |
| 2    | shieldStatus            | bitfield| Status flags (see Section 10.5)          |
| 3    | energyCoreLevel         | 0-100   | Reserved (placeholder)                   |
| 4    | distortionFieldStrength | 0-100   | Volume level (placeholder)               |

| 6    | lastContact             | 0-255   | Seconds since last BLE communication     |

**FR-19**
Last contact tracking:

- The system tracks the timestamp of the last BLE communication.
- Communication includes: incoming reads, incoming writes, and outgoing notifications.
- The `lastContact` field in GalacticStatus reports seconds since last communication.
- Value is clamped to 255 (max uint8_t) for interactions older than 255 seconds.
- When notifications are sent every 500ms, lastContact should always be 0-1.

**FR-20**
Periodic status notifications:

- GalacticStatus notifications are pushed automatically 2 times per second (every 500ms).
- Notifications are sent only when a client is connected and has enabled notifications via CCCD.
- Timer is started on BLE connect and stopped on disconnect.

**FR-21**
Mute function:

- Command 0x04 mutes/unmutes audio output completely.
- Mute is applied with smooth gain fade (no clicks).
- Mute state is reported in shieldStatus bit 0.

**FR-22**
Audio Duck (Panic Button):

- Command 0x05 enables/disables Audio Duck mode.
- Reduces volume to approximately 25% (-12 dB) when activated.
- Applied with smooth gain transition.
- Audio Duck state is reported in shieldStatus bit 1.
- Quick toggle on/off for "panic" situations.

**FR-23**
Normalizer (Dynamic Range Compression):

- Command 0x06 enables/disables the normalizer.
- Applies dynamic range compression:
  - Threshold: -20 dB
  - Ratio: 4:1
  - Attack: 7 ms
  - Release: 150 ms
  - Makeup gain: +6 dB
- Makes quiet sounds louder and loud sounds quieter.
- Perfect for late-night viewing or noisy environments.
- Normalizer state is reported in shieldStatus bit 3.

| L1  | Low-shelf  |  140 Hz | +2.5 dB | S=0.8     |
| L2  | High-shelf | 8500 Hz | +1.0 dB | S=0.7     |

### 9.2 Constraints

- Loudness must not make "FULL + Loudness" extremely boomy; overlay is intentionally mild.
- Implementation must apply parameter smoothing when toggling.

## 10. BLE GATT Interface

### 10.1 Goal

A generic BLE app must be able to write presets/loudness and read status.

| Service UUID     | Included        | Service UUID in advertising packet |

The advertising packet contains the service UUID for filtering/discovery. The scan response contains the device name and TX power.

### 10.7 Connection Parameters

On connection, the following parameters are requested to optimize latency (FR-14):

| Parameter    | Value   | Description                       |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Min Interval | 20ms    | Minimum connection interval       |
| Max Interval | 40ms    | Maximum connection interval       |
| Latency      | 0       | Slave latency (no skipped events) |
| Timeout      | 4000ms  | Supervision timeout               |

## 11. State Machine and Error Handling

### 11.1 BLE connect/disconnect

- On BLE connect:
  - Connection parameters are updated for low latency (FR-14)
  - Last contact timestamp is initialized
  - GalacticStatus notification timer is started (FR-20)
  - Status values are updated and ready for read
- On BLE disconnect:
  - Audio continues playing; settings remain active (FR-15)
  - Notifications are disabled
  - GalacticStatus notification timer is stopped
  - Advertising is automatically restarted
- On reboot: settings are loaded from NVS; status notify on first connect (read/notify).

### 11.2 Unknown command / value

- Unknown CMD: ignore; send status back unchanged.
- VAL out of range: v1 recommendation: ignore and notify status.

## 12. Persistency

### 12.1 Fields to store

- preset_id (uint8)
- loudness (uint8)
- (optional) bass_level, treble_level
- config_version (uint8)

### 12.2 Write policy

- Do not flash on every BLE write.
- Debounce: write after **1-2 seconds** without new changes.

## 13. Performance and Real-time Requirements

### 13.1 Audio task priority

- Audio pipeline tasks have highest priority.
- BLE handling must never run in the audio callback.

### 13.2 Parameter smoothing

- On preset change: crossfade/parameter ramp (**20-50 ms**) to prevent clicks.
- Filter coefficient updates: switch in one go with output ramp, or interpolate per block.
- Mute, Audio Duck, and Normalizer use smooth gain transitions.
